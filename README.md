you wanna look at the [pickhaxe tutorial](https://github.com/EliteMasterEric/PickHaxe/wiki/Tutorial:-Your-First-Mod/)<br>
(steps 1, 2, 2.1, 3, 6)<br>
(in step 1, use haxe binaries from [here](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/actions/runs/10197805242) because the one that's linked in the tutorial is expired)
<br><br><br>
i would upload the generated java files but github desktop mildly dislikes me
